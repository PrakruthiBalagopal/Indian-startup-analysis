# Indian-startup-analysis
Analysing the startup situation in India

A startup is a company that is in the first stage of its operations. These companies 
are often initially bankrolled by their entrepreneurial founders as they attempt to 
capitalize on developing a product or service for which they believe there is a 
demand. 
The main factor that influences the success of the startup is the idea which further 
gets implemented. A significant number of startups fail because of lack of 
awareness about the progress of that particular domain. Every entrepreneur 
aims at development and success of his/her organization.

In this project we focus on the following:
● Our study explores the trends in the startup ecosystem in India by 
comparing the startups with different initial variables which received 
funding.
● To study the trends and growth pattern in funding received by Indian 
startups and to analyze the stages of funding received by startups in India.
● To analyze if the funding received by startups is dependent on the location 
and Industry vertical.
● How much funding does startups generally get in India ? (maximum 
funding, minimum funding , average funding and number of fundings)
● Which industries are favored by investors for funding ? (OR) Which type 
of companies get more easily funded ?
● Do cities play a major role in funding ? (OR) Which city has maximum 
startups ?
● Who are the most important investors in the Indian startup ecosystem ?
● What are the different types of funding stages that the startups are in ?
